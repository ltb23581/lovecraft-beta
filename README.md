# 💛 Love.Craft Beta Website

This repository contains the **beta version** of our redesigned website for **Love.Craft Athens**, built using the NMI Project Website template.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This is **not the official Love.Craft Athens website**.  
> Instead, it serves as an **additional site** created by our UGA New Media Capstone team to **showcase our project deliverables, design process, and team contributions** throughout the development of the Love.Craft redesign.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is hosted via **GitHub Pages** for easy preview and collaboration.
